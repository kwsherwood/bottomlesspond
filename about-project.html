          <p>Bottomless Pond: or, the Walden Zone</p>

<p>Bottomless Pond is a digital composition with relation to e-poetry and net art.  It aims to engage users/readers/visitors in a thoughtful, reflective, immersive (?) &amp; slow reading of excerpted sentences from the Thoreau corpus. A soothing, slow-text environment creates an experience differentiating from much online reading which is characterized by skipping, linking, and the rapid eye saccades of distracted thought.  In this sense, normative online reading practices might be symptomatic of the emptying of language that concerned Thoreau; hence the interest in returning to a different kind of reading, through an environment and interface that offers language in an environment of near stillness.  (Or as near as a networked digital composition might get.)</p>

<p>Source: Thoreau's Walden or Life in the Woods provides a rich reservoir of reflections on time, technology, the self and mind in a changing environment. As a kind of resistance text it advocates a kind of slow living and a reading of classics. Now, itself, as classic, Walden speaks to the contemporary reader in an increasingly distracted era. Thus creating a remediation(remix, adaptation, ?) Allows for a slowed reading experience that detourns the digital ethos of the Bottomless Pond platform.  </p>

<p>References: Walden, Buddhism, ambient poetics, kinetic poem, anti-Futurism</p>

<p>Interface: The text appears slowly, a sentence or phrase - fading up or emerging from digital shadows - giving the reader an indicator of temporality, but of a slow unfolding.  It sets a pace or rhythm that is on the biological scale of attentiveness and not the flicker of the screen (despite, obviously and ironically being presented through that very medium).</p>

<p>Text: Selected, arranged, and recontextualized (but NOT altered) the Thoreau text is chosen to engage attention but also to allow some free wandering of the mind. The reader might feel an arousal of attention but not like he is receiving a lecture. Hence sentences at most are revealed.  The day dreaming of a poetic-philosophical attentiveness is invited by the pairing of sentence, perhaps with a moderate disjunction and temporal and/or spatial gap. One line .... revealing ... and then the second part of the couplet.  These must have some plausible associative, thematic, phonic, or lexical connection.  We don't want the reader to perceive it as nonsense but as almost sense - couplet as Koan?  </p>

<p>Database: The piece should seem to pour slowly forth as from a bottomless well, disclosed over time (minutes for the resolution of a verse; perhaps hours, days, weeks, a year for the full. For example, it might disclose a pair of lines over a five minute period and then be refreshed with a new set, perhaps appearing one at a time. In terms of the user experience, does it reset each day; does it persist, tracking what you have "read"and what you have not?Can I compartmentalize the database into 12 months/ 4 seasons, and then program it to draw on a different section over time (and will most readers get to experien e this subtle variation across time? And if not, is it enough to know that it would be different? Maybe there are ways to signal "season" or other temporal markers?</p>

<p>Year
    Spring | summer | winter | fall</p>

<pre><code>    Month 1, 2, 3

    Morning, Afternoon, Night (36 subsets)  
</code></pre>

<p>[There needs to be some kind of real-time date link, whether as granular as "daily"or broader. But you want a repeat visitor to have the sense of a change. Think of Chris Ault's piece that is visually formatted to reflect the weather. Some parallel sign that the book knows the temporality is crucial. Explore this in terms of feasibility of creating the counters and also of how this kind of chunking will effect or limit the reading of the database. Does it become too fractured, too varied if cut broken into 36 periods or more?]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>caveat - the reader should experience a sense of temporal responsiveness, but you don't want to replicate the regimentation of time characteristic of the railroad.  Possibly using a turbulence factor (like quarter of the hour, which wouldn't be visible could insure that the experience is varied when the reader pulls it up again the next hour or day. )  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Themes: machine, self, book, language, time, nature, presence, light, reflection, tranquility, awareness, awakening. </p>

<p>Issues:The digital, distracted condition and the kinds of reading that e-readers do not facilitate. Also a providing a counterpoint to the kinetic, frantic and interactive trends in very lively digital art. </p>

<p>One wants to call this almost a kind of ambient textual art, except there is that danger that this seems so conceptual as to not require reading or to be trivial. In fact, content and reflection - the specific language is very important, not exchangeable. </p>

<p>Plan is to select and arrange sentences/phrases/measures carefully.  But not to alter.  (Consider possibility of substitutions. Is this consistent with the overall idea?Maybe not.)  Consider degree of fragmentation, effected by 'size' of measure, and distance/gaps between the textual units selected in pairs or across a composition. Perhaps fragmentation can be buffered if each visit begins with at one of  a marked  set of start points, i.e. verses which have a prelude feel.  [example: database has 1000 paired verses, perhaps in some kind of parallelism rhyme etc. These are grouped into seasons of 250 each. Then 1/10th of these are identified as starting points, and so a Spring/Morning reading would begin with one of 8.3 starting moments.  A different set would be available to the Spring evening, etc. ]
Even "breath"is worth thinking about in this context.  </p>

<p>There can be some recurrence but the loop should we a long journey, over many hours and seasons.  </p>

<p>Rhythms such as the lunar month, or the body should be evoked. Nothing as simple as a clock/calednar. But maybe color or other moves to indicate it knows?  (Are there some appropriate Dawn/Dusk or Spring/Fall epigraphs one could use to index the time?)</p>

<p>A poem but also a website or an app.  This piece should b e equally approachable as a literary work, a screen-saver, and a meditation tool.  (This last, true? Consider whether the period of a reading can be setup to effectively give a "sitting"-like periodicity.  Consider if there can be a bell!  I'd like to give folks the sense that they can live with the poem on a screen all afternoon BUT also a sense that they have read a "section" that , if not conveying closure, at least gives them an opportunity to stop without feeling they are "killing the program."  ((This will have to be implemented cleverly.  ))</p>

<p>Visual:
Color scheme:first thought, white/gray on black. A sober but calm background. Perhaps give a sense of passing time with light/shadow effectrs on the letters. Hard to use environmental images without being very derrivative and cutesy. </p>

<p>Fade/reveal:
There should be no flashing and no migraine inducing shifts.  Avoid ppt cliches but give some kind of graduate fade in (perhaps per letter / word rather than the whole at once.  Decide whether to show a pair of lines or have the reader keep one (which fades) in memory while the other begins to appear. An overlay video that becomes less opaque might work. ALso possible to being with the descent into the pond. An immersion scenario. ?</p>
